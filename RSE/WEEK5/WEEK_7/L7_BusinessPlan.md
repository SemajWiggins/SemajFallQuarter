SAW Builds

Identity:
SAW Builds manufactures quality 3d prints of characters and accesories from fiction that customers can put on display, fisget with, and more. We also take 3d printing requests from customers!

Problem:
There is a lack of high quality, customizeable collectables, and fidget items for many different fandoms.

Solution
We offer customers high quality, customizeable collectables, and fidget items that accurately represent their character, gives them their specific taste, is fidget friendly, and isn't cheaply made.

Target Market
The target market is for people that enjoy fiction  want to fidget, and collect high quality builds that represent their desired character.

Competition
My competition would be 3d printing businesses that have a wide fan base, and that deliver internationally.

Market activities
I will post videos on social media platforms that display the prints and their function. Soon I will try making ads for them to be put up on websites. 

Team and key roles 
I currently am the only employee/worker, but I plan to hire more employees once my business starts growing.

Expenses
There are only two expenses which is filament, and the shipping company.

Revenue Streams
